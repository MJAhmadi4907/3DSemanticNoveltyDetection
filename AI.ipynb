the analysis of overconfidence within the MSP baseline, a histogram plot was generated to visualize the distribution of data. The histogram illustrates two distinct sets of data: the source data, represented by blue bars indicating density, and the target data, depicted by orange bars. The x-axis denotes the MSP score, while the y-axis represents density. An observation from the plot reveals a significant overlap between the source and target data around the MSP score of 0.97. This overlap indicates a tendency towards overconfidence in the model.
